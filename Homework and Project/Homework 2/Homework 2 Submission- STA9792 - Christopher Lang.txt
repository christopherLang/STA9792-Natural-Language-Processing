Question 4.3
The articles used for comparison was an article written by the New York Times
and one from the BBC. References to the articles are below:


Goel, V. (2017, September 10). With a $1,000 Price Tag, Appleâ€™s iPhone Crosses a Threshold. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/10/technology/apple-iphone-price.html

Anderson, H. (2017, September 6). How Americanisms are killing the english language. http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20170904-how-americanisms-are-killing-the-english-language


The New York Times articles is about the upcoming iPhone 8, and the BBC article
discusses how the author's British English is being corrupted by American
English.

For both articles, the most common types of unigrams are stopwords. For example,
the word "the" is the most common unigram for both bodies of text. Other common
unigrams include the word "a" and "to". These stopwords are often used heavily
to help the author create cohesive and proper sentences, in order to convey
ideas to the reader quickly and efficiently

Of course, there are differences in the unigrams. Within the top 20 unigrams for
the New York Times article, the words "iphone", "phone", and "apple" are among
the most common non-stopword unigrams. This is to be expected, as the article's
content is specifically about the upcoming iPhone

Within the top 20 unigrams of the BBC article, unique unigrams specific to the
content show up, such as "american", "english", and "british". Notably, the BBC
article's top 10 unigrams are all stopwords, showing some differences between the
author's writing style, or how the subject dictates the words used


Bigrams begin to show significant differences, more so than commonalities. In
the BBC article, the most common bigram is "I was", indicating that the article
is much more personal than the New York Times article. The next two,
"British English" and "American English" are relevant to the article's subject.
The author is likely comparing and/or contrasting the two types of English

In comparison, the most common bigrams in the New York Times Article is
"The New" and then "The iPhone", which hints that the article is discussing the
new iPhone that is soon to be released (speculated at least). Other common but
important bigrams include "in Brazil" and "in China", which is in regards to the
two large and growing markets that Apple is competing in with the iPhone

Unigrams suffer from stopwords and the lack of word lemmatization/stemming.
Without performing this cleaning step, unigrams is filled with noisy data, making
it difficult to ascertain the content of the article without reading it

Bigrams suffers from this less, and can often improve the interpretation of the
bigrams. For example, in regards to bigrams, there were very little common bigrams
between the two articles (there were a few but mostly stopwords) and was more
easily interpretable to a human
